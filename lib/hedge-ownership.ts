/**
 * On-Chain Hedge Ownership Registry
 * 
 * Maps commitmentHash (used as hedgeId in the gasless flow) → user walletAddress.
 * Persisted as a JSON file so the close API can verify the caller truly owns the hedge
 * without relying on the on-chain trader field (which is the relayer in ZK-private mode).
 * 
 * Security model:
 *  - On OPEN: walletAddress is recorded against the hedgeId
 *  - On CLOSE: user must present an EIP-712 signature from that same wallet
 *  - The relayer never reveals user wallets on-chain, but the API can verify ownership off-chain
