/**
 * Proxy PDA (Program Derived Address) System
 * 
 * Similar to Solana PDAs - generates deterministic proxy addresses
 * that have NO private keys. Only the owner can authorize withdrawals.
 * 
 * Flow:
 * 1. Owner creates hedge → PDA proxy address derived deterministically
 * 2. Proxy address is used on-chain (no one has the private key)
 * 3. Only owner can prove ownership via ZK binding
 * 4. Withdrawal always goes back to owner wallet
 * 
 * Security: The proxy address is just a "vault" - no one can spend from it
 * except through the smart contract which verifies ZK ownership proof.
