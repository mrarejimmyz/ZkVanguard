# 🚀 Chronos Vanguard - Pre-Seed Pitch Deck

## 🎯 The Problem

**$16 Trillion RWA Market** is coming on-chain by 2030 (BCG Report)

**BUT:** Institutional investors face:
- ❌ Manual risk management (slow, error-prone)
- ❌ No automated hedging for volatile RWA positions
- ❌ High gas costs for settlements (60-80% inefficiency)
- ❌ Lack of verifiable audit trails
- ❌ Custodial risk with centralized solutions

**Result:** Institutions avoid DeFi RWA markets → $1.2T opportunity locked

---
