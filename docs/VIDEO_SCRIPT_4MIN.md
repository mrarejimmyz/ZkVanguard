- Transition to calm ZkVanguard dashboard

### Narration

> "What if you could see a market crash coming... 3 days before it happens?"

>

### Narration

> "Here's the problem: Institutional crypto traders manage portfolios worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But they're flying blind."
>
> "Traditional tools REACT after crashes happen — that means losing millions before any protection kicks in."
>
> "Manual hedging takes 15 to 30 minutes. In crypto, that's an eternity."
>
> "Gas fees? They're crushing — $50,000 to $200,000 per year, just in transaction costs."
>
> "And privacy? Your competitors can see every move you make on-chain."
>
> "$1.2 trillion in institutional capital is sitting on the sidelines because of these problems."

### On-Screen Text
- "15-30 min manual response time"
- "$50K-$200K annual gas costs"
- "Zero privacy on public chains"

### Narration

> "ZkVanguard changes everything."
>
> "We built the world's first PREDICTIVE AI risk platform — powered by 6 specialized AI agents that work 24/7 to protect your portfolio."
>
> "Here's what makes us different:"
>
> "**One: Prediction Intelligence.** We integrate with Polymarket and Delphi prediction markets. When there's a 73% probability of a Bitcoin crash, our AI doesn't wait — it acts BEFORE the crash happens."
>
> "**Two: Six AI Agents.** Lead, Risk, Hedging, Settlement, Reporting, and Price Monitor. They coordinate autonomously. Natural language commands like 'Hedge my Bitcoin exposure if crash risk exceeds 70%' — they understand and execute."
>
> "**Three: Zero Gas Fees.** Our x402 gasless protocol covers 97.4% of all transactions. That's $200,000 saved per year."
>
> "**Four: Post-Quantum Privacy.** 521-bit ZK-STARK proofs protect your portfolio details. Competitors can't see your positions. Auditors can verify compliance without seeing sensitive data."
>
> "**Five: Multi-Chain.** Cronos and SUI networks. Unified portfolio view. Best of both worlds."
