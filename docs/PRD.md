## Compliance & Data Privacy

### Regulatory Approach

**Non-Custodial Design (Primary Defense):**
- ✅ Users control private keys (MetaMask, Sui Wallet)
- ✅ No custody of funds = Not a money transmitter
- ✅ Platform facilitates, doesn't execute = Likely not a broker-dealer
- ✅ Smart contracts are tools, not financial advice = Not an RIA

**Data Privacy Strategy:**

| Regulation | Requirement | Our Approach | Compliance Status |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **GDPR** (EU) | Minimal data collection, right to deletion | Only store wallet addresses (no PII), ZK proofs eliminate on-chain PII | ✅ Compliant by design |
| **CCPA** (California) | Disclose data usage, deletion rights | Privacy policy discloses wallet address storage, easy deletion | ✅ Compliant |
| **SOC2** (Enterprise) | Security controls audit | Required for institutional sales, audit planned Q3 2026 | ⏳ Planned (Q3 2026) |

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks

**Risk 1: Smart Contract Vulnerability**
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Could lose user funds, destroy reputation
- **Probability:** LOW (contracts tested, but not formally audited yet)
- **Mitigation:**
  - ✅ Complete: 80%+ test coverage, 10/10 integration tests
  - ⏳ In Progress: Smart contract audit scheduled (Feb 2026, $30K-$50K budget)
  - 📋 Planned: Bug bounty program ($10K-$50K rewards)
  - 🔒 Safeguard: Non-custodial design limits exposure to user-signed transactions only

**Risk 2: x402 Gasless Service Disruption**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Users must pay gas fees, breaks value proposition
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (dependency on external service)
- **Mitigation:**
  - ✅ Graceful fallback to paid gas (97.4% gasless, 2.6% fallback tested)
  - ✅ User notification system for service status
  - 📋 Contract balance monitoring (alert when <5 TCRO)
  - 📋 Diversify: Research alternative gasless solutions (Gelato, Biconomy)

**Risk 3: AI Model Accuracy / Hallucinations**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Incorrect hedging decisions could increase losses
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (LLMs known to hallucinate)
- **Mitigation:**
  - ✅ Rule-based validation layer (sanity checks on all AI outputs)
  - ✅ Human-in-the-loop: Users approve strategies before execution
  - ✅ Confidence scoring: Only suggest strategies with >80% confidence
  - 📋 A/B testing: Compare AI vs rule-based performance
  - 📋 Circuit breaker: Auto-disable agent if error rate >5%

### Medium Priority Risks

**Risk 4: Slow User Adoption**
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Delays revenue, increases burn rate
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (new market, unproven demand)
- **Mitigation:**
  - 💰 Conservative runway: 12-month budget at current burn
  - 🎯 Focused ICP: Target 50 qualified leads before broad launch
  - 🎁 Incentives: 3-month free trial, referral program (20% commission)
  - 📊 Rapid iteration: Weekly user feedback sessions, 2-week sprint cycles

**Risk 5: Regulatory Uncertainty**
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Could require costly compliance changes
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (crypto regulations evolving)
- **Mitigation:**
  - ⚖️ Non-custodial design (users control keys)
  - 🌍 Geo-restrictions: Block high-risk jurisdictions (US, China)
  - 📋 Legal counsel: Consult crypto-specialized law firm
  - 🔒 Privacy-first: ZK proofs may actually help compliance (prove without revealing)

**Risk 6: Key Person Dependency**
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Loss of technical lead could delay roadmap
- **Probability:** LOW (stable team)
- **Mitigation:**
  - 📚 Documentation: Comprehensive architecture docs
  - 🤝 Knowledge sharing: Weekly team syncs, code reviews
  - 💼 Equity incentives: Vesting schedules to retain talent
  - 📋 Hiring plan: Add 2-3 engineers by Q3 2026

### Low Priority Risks
**Risk 7 (Competitor):** LOW-MEDIUM impact, LOW prob | First-mover (6+ months ahead), network effects, continuous innovation  
**Risk 8 (CoinGecko Limits):** LOW impact, MEDIUM prob | Fallbacks (RPC, VVS), upgrade to Pro ($499/mo @100 users), caching (80% reduction)

---

## Open Issues

**Technical:**
1. CUDA cloud scaling for ZK proofs - researching AWS/GCP GPU
2. x402 rate limits - awaiting x402 team response
3. CoinGecko costs - budgeting Pro tier ($499/mo)
4. SUI Move expertise - 2-week training sprint Mar 2026, consultant budget
5. Cross-chain VaR calculations - researching correlation models
6. SUI gas sponsorship limits - contacting SUI Foundation

**Business:**
1. Smart contract audit - evaluating Quantstamp/Trail of Bits/OpenZeppelin ($20K-$50K)
2. Beta recruitment - Cronos ecosystem outreach
3. Pricing validation - user interviews Q1

## Q&A

| Asked By | Question | Answer |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Engineering | Can we scale ZK proof generation to 1000+ users? | Yes, with cloud GPU infrastructure (AWS EC2 P3 instances). Estimated cost: $2/user/month. |
| Product | Why 5 agents instead of 1 general-purpose agent? | Specialized agents provide better accuracy and allow parallel execution. Each agent has domain expertise (risk analysis, hedging, settlements, etc.). |
| Marketing | How do we explain ZK proofs to non-technical users? | Analogy: "Like a sealed envelope that proves you have the right document inside without opening it." Focus on privacy benefit, not cryptography. |
| Finance | What's customer acquisition cost (CAC) target? | $500 for Pro users, $2,000 for Institutional. LTV:CAC ratio target is 15:1. |
| Engineering | What if x402 gasless fails? | Graceful fallback to traditional gas payment. User notification: "Gasless unavailable, paying 0.02 CRO gas." |
| Product | **Why Cronos first, then SUI? Why not Ethereum?** | **Cronos has production-ready x402 gasless integration + lower dev costs. SUI validates multi-chain architecture with sub-second finality + native gas sponsorship. Ethereum expansion requires more capital ($100K+ for mainnet gas) after PMF proven on 2 chains.** |
| Engineering | **Why SUI over Polygon/Arbitrum for second chain?** | **SUI offers: (1) Sub-second finality (faster hedges), (2) Native gas sponsorship (no external dependency), (3) Move language security advantages, (4) Less competition in SUI DeFi ecosystem = easier to win market share.** |
| Security | What happens if ZK proof is invalid? | Transaction reverts on-chain. Agent retries proof generation with adjusted parameters. User notified if 3 consecutive failures. |
| Business | How do we compete with centralized platforms like Binance? | We're non-custodial (users control keys) + privacy-preserving (Binance sees all trades) + autonomous AI (Binance requires manual trading). Different market segments. |
| Product | **Will users need two wallets (Cronos + SUI)?** | **V1.5: Yes, users connect separate wallets (MetaMask for Cronos, Sui Wallet for SUI). V2: We'll add wallet abstraction to enable single-wallet experience across chains.** |
